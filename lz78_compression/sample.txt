By leveraging advanced algorithms Huffman encoding and LZ algorithms, the application aims to optimize storage space and enhance bandwidth efficiency for network file sharing.\nWe are planning to use 100% C++ programming so that we can build all the data structures from scratch and achieve great execution time. WxWidgets library is used to develop GUI applications. WxWidgets is a widget toolkit and tools library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for cross-platform applications.\nThe user-friendly interface enables easy file selection, ensuring a seamless experience while saving storage and reducing network bandwidth overhead. \nWe also plan to expand this to compress files other than text files and also to compress the whole directory at once.\nCompression flowchart:\nRead File -> Huffman Encoding -> LZ78 Compression -> Write File\nDecompression flowchart:\nRead File -> LZ78->Decompression -> Huffman Decoding -> Write File\n\n\nDATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS USED\nHuffman Coding\nHuffman Coding is a technique of compressing data to reduce its size without losing any of the details.It is used to compress files efficiently by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols.The DSA topics used in this algorithm are:\nHuffman Tree\nA Huffman tree, similar to a binary tree data structure, needs to be created having n leaf nodes and n-1 internal nodes\nPriority Queue\nPriority Queue is used for building the Huffman tree such that nodes with lowest frequency have the highest priority. A Min Heap data structure can be used to implement the functionality of a priority queue.\nGreedy Algorithm\nA greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesnt worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.\nRecursive Algorithms\nRecursive algorithms are problem-solving techniques where a function calls itself to break down a problem into smaller instances. \nTree Traversal (Pre-order)\nTree traversal refers to the process of visiting and processing each node in a tree data structure. \n\nLZ algorithm\nThe LZ algorithm has mainly two variants: LZ77 and LZ78.\nLZ algorithm also used for lossless data compression.LZ77 is a dictionary-based algorithm that replaces repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy, making it a form of compression.The DSA topics used in this algorithm are:\nString Processing:\nString processing involves manipulating and analyzing sequences of characters. \nDynamic Programming\nDynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems.\nDictionary Data Structures\nDictionary data structures, often known as associative arrays or maps, store key-value pairs.\nGreedy Algorithms\nGreedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.\nData Compression Techniques\nData compression involves reducing the size of data to save storage space or transmission bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly! Heres a passage for you:In the heart of a bustling city, where the sounds of traffic and the buzz of people merge into a symphony of urban life, there lies a hidden oasis. Tucked away between towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, this sanctuary is a refuge for those seeking solace in the midst of chaos. As you enter, a serene garden unfolds, adorned with vibrant flowers and the soothing melody of chirping birds. Stone pathways meander through the greenery, leading to quiet corners where one can find a moment of tranquility. The air is filled with the sweet fragrance of blooming blossoms, creating a sensory tapestry that transports visitors away from the hectic pace of city living.In this peaceful haven, time seems to slow down. The gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze and the distant hum of city life become a harmonious backdrop to contemplation. Benches invite weary souls to rest and reflect, offering a respite from the demands of the outside world.As the sun sets, casting a warm glow over the landscape, the oasis takes on a magical quality. Soft hues of orange and pink paint the sky, and the citys relentless energy begins to fade. The transition from day to night brings a quiet magic to the sanctuary, turning it into a place of quiet reflection and introspection.In the heart of this urban oasis, amidst the juxtaposition of nature and the metropolis, one discovers the delicate balance between chaos and serenity. It serves as a reminder that, even in the busiest of places, there exists a haven for those who seek a moment of peace and connection with the natural world.Nepal, nestled in the lap of the Himalayas, is a land of breathtaking landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and warm hospitality. Home to eight of the worlds fourteen highest peaks, including the majestic Mount Everest, Nepal has long been a magnet for adventure seekers and mountaineers from around the globe. The diverse topography of the country ranges from the towering peaks of the Himalayas in the north to the subtropical lowlands in the south, offering a remarkable variety of ecosystems and climates within its relatively small territory. Beyond its geographical wonders, Nepal boasts a tapestry of cultural diversity, with a mosaic of ethnic groups, languages, and traditions coexisting harmoniously. The vibrant capital city, Kathmandu, is a living museum of ancient temples, intricate palaces, and bustling marketplaces, showcasing the countrys rich history and religious heritage. The Hindu and Buddhist influences are deeply ingrained in daily life, with pilgrimage sites like Pashupatinath and Lumbini attracting devotees and spiritual seekers alike. The rural landscapes of Nepal tell tales of agrarian life, where terraced fields paint the hillsides and traditional villages dot the countryside. The kindness and resilience of the Nepalese people shine through, particularly evident in their ability to rebuild and unite after natural disasters such as the devastating earthquake of 2015. As a global melting pot of culture, nature, and spirituality, Nepal continues to captivate the hearts of those who venture into its captivating realms, leaving an indelible mark on all who experience its unique charm.kdsakfna snisfakdnjk fasdinsdkfj nkn f inksdnfksck iinsdfkjnsckjdsk iiknkdsfksjncdsk i fnidsnksdnjsfnskjfn okifnsdk knkfnkfsnfksdnfksnfksjfnkfjn knksdnfk fnksdfksdnfksdnfkjfnvfskfslkfmlwejoifjewojoewjoi vknknknfkjsnfsdni ikfneksfniweknfiwekjfiweakfnwekf mdsovnkjfvn&fdjnfksnjo(jefsdkno()joknksdnckjdsnfNINNKdjnkjfcnksdnkjfnkjdsnkcn]]asoidjoj]]knkefdnskndskne39398u32ut934i5i ijfinsdkn ikfkdsnk ifkdsnkf wefikdsnkdnc dkfnsjk idfknkjfn kfnknkdn wojoifj jeowjeoewjo aea air apple ball cat dog egg fan gun home ice jack king long monkey name oman person queen rest statistics track uav van water xylophoe zero yarn asdfjckdsnj sd joawkjeo  aewfokwaeopj ejofjlaml  omvmknmdkv oo dmvklm onkndkvmo oijod vklm oi voidvndok Nepal, nestled in the lap of the Himalayas, is a land of breathtaking landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and warm hospitality.
